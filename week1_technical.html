                Knotch is the simplest way to share your opinions and express your emotions about any topic, whether it’s positive or negative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knotch is the Twitter for the 99%: it gives everyone a stage to express their opinions/thoughts in front of all those who care about the topic in discussion. Moreover, it's the first network that allows users to create an identity based on their interests & opinions (aka knotches) and to connect with like-minded people from outside of their social graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knotch's color rating system makes it fun and fast for you to tell everyone that the burrito you just devoured was incredible, to warn people that the movie you watched was the most boring two hours of your life or to take a stance and show the world that you support gay marriage rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                All opinions are safe, all opinions are heard, all opinions count, and knotching is the best way to express them.   
            </p>

            <div class="content"><h2>Vimeo</h2></div>
            <img class= "thumbnail" src="Vimeo screenshot.jpg">
            <p> 
                In 2004, Vimeo was founded by a group of filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community of individuals with a wide range of passions. Today, millions of people from all around the world enjoy Vimeo, and we’re growing bigger every day.

            Vimeo is the home for your videos. It makes them look great, easy to share, and simple to save.

            Upload videos to Vimeo right from your Camera Roll and share them with friends. Then feast your eyeballs on gorgeous HD playback with no ads before, after, or on top of your videos. In your feed you’ll find a handful of amazing Staff Picks curated by the Vimeo team every day, plus videos by your friends, family, and other cool people around the world.

            And if you like to watch while you’re on the move, maybe on train or plane, you can check out videos in your Watch Later queue without an Internet connection.
